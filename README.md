## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview  
This repository contains a **Pick and Place Robot Simulation** developed in **Gazebo** using **ROS 2**.  
Through this project, I explored various ROS 2 libraries and concepts, including:  
âœ… **MoveIt** â€“ Motion planning for robot manipulation  
âœ… **Robot Kinematics** â€“ Understanding forward and inverse kinematics  
âœ… **Gazebo Simulation** â€“ Visualizing and testing robotic movement  
âœ… **TF2 (Transform Library)** â€“ Managing coordinate frames  

## ðŸ“š Key Learnings 
- Implemented Inverse Kinematics for robotic arm movement
- Used MoveIt for motion planning and collision avoidance
- Simulated the environment in Gazebo with object detection
- Explored TF2 to track robot transformations
